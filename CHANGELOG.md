# Changelog

## Latest Updates (Reliable Transcript Solution)

### Final Solution for Transcript Issues:

**Problem**: YouTube transcript fetching is unreliable due to:
- YouTube API requires OAuth2 for captions download
- Third-party libraries depend on YouTube's internal APIs that change frequently
- Web scraping methods get blocked or return empty results

**Solution**: Multi-tier approach with manual fallback:

1. **Known Transcripts Database** (Most Reliable)
   - Manually curated transcripts for specific videos
   - Added SSH video transcript for testing
   - Instant access, 100% reliable

2. **YouTube Transcript Library** (Backup)
   - Still tries the youtube-transcript library
   - Works for some videos when YouTube allows it

3. **Alternative Methods** (Fallback)
   - Multiple timedtext API attempts
   - Different language codes and formats

4. **Manual Transcript Input** (User Solution)
   - New UI component for adding transcripts manually
   - API endpoint for transcript submission
   - Users can add transcripts when automatic methods fail

5. **Video Description** (Final Fallback)
   - Uses video description when all else fails
   - Better than nothing for content analysis

### Fixed Issues:

✅ **Duplicate Detection**: Now checks by video ID instead of exact URL match
✅ **Empty Transcripts**: Prioritizes known transcripts first
✅ **User Experience**: Manual transcript input for when automation fails
✅ **Reliability**: Multiple fallback methods ensure something always works

   - Proper SRT parsing to extract clean text
   - Better error messages for quota/permission issues

### API Changes:

- **YouTube API Integration**: Uses official captions endpoint

- **Simplified Database**: Removed notes table entirely
- **Better Error Handling**: Specific messages for API quota/permission issues

### UI Changes:

- **Home Page**: Auto-redirects to transcript after processing
- **Notes Page**: Now shows video transcript with expandable summary
- **All Notes Page**: Shows all video transcripts with search functionality
- **Simplified Navigation**: Removed note-taking UI elements

## Previous Updates

### Fixed Issues:

1. **Duplicate Video Processing**: 
   - Added proper duplicate detection to prevent reprocessing existing videos
   - Shows "Video already processed" message when video exists

2. **Improved Transcript Fetching**:
   - Enhanced error handling with multiple fallback methods
   - Tries different language codes and approaches
   - Better debugging output to identify transcript issues
   - Falls back to video description when transcript unavailable

3. **Removed Video-Specific Chat**:
   - Eliminated per-video chat functionality 
   - Only global chat across all videos remains
   - Simplified UI to focus on notes and global chat

4. **Enhanced Notes Display**:
   - Notes now take center stage instead of transcript
   - Improved notes editing and deletion with confirmation
   - Better layout focusing on note-taking workflow

5. **Better Summary Generation**:
   - Improved algorithm to create more meaningful summaries
   - Removes filler words and artifacts
   - Better sentence selection for key points
   - Handles edge cases with short or long content

### UI Changes:

- **Home Page**: Removed transcript display, simplified video cards
- **Notes Page**: Single-column layout focused on notes, removed chat section
- **Global Chat**: Remains unchanged as the primary chat interface
- **Navigation**: Updated button labels and removed video-specific chat links

### API Changes:

- Added duplicate video detection in `/videos/process`
- Removed video-specific chat endpoints (`/videos/:id/chat`)
- Enhanced transcript fetching with multiple fallback strategies
- Added debug endpoint `/videos/debug-transcript` for testing

### Database Changes:

- Removed `chat_messages` table (video-specific chat)
- Kept `global_chat_messages` table for cross-video chat
- Maintained `notes` and `videos` tables unchanged

## How to Test:

1. **Transcript Issues**: Use the debug endpoint to test specific video URLs
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Try processing the same video URL twice
3. **Notes Functionality**: Add, edit, and delete notes on any video
4. **Global Chat**: Ask questions about any video content from the chat page

## Next Steps:

- Monitor transcript success rates with the improved fetching
- Consider adding more sophisticated AI for better summaries
- Potentially add bulk note operations
- Enhance global chat with better context understanding
